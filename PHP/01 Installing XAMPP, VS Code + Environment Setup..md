# Installing XAMPP, VS Code + Environment Setup | PHP Tutorial #1

## Introduction to this Course
In this series of videos, you will learn Php from starting to the very end. If you are a beginner in the world of PHP programming or even unfamiliar with coding, these video tutorials will help you to develop and deploy your own website using Php.

Before getting our hands dirty with PHP programming, let's set up the tools and environment necessary for this session. The exact installation instructions are provided in the video but I will mention the tools we installed quickly for your future reference.

You will have to download a Microsoft code editor named Visual Studio Code (or any other source code editor of your choice). It is one of the best code editors that provides a very smooth programming experience. There are a lot of other features that make this editor one of the best, like colored keywords, files, and folder navigation panel, syntax autocomplete, etc. But since I have already made a video on VS Code I will not talk a lot about it here. The other thing I installed for working with PHP code is XAMPP. XAMPP is a free and easy-to-use Apache distribution containing Maria DB and PHP.  I have used it through this Php Course. The XAMPP open source package has been designed to be incredibly easy to install and easy to use. Let's see how we can get these softwares quickly into our computers.

## VS Code
1. Go to the link https://code.visualstudio.com/download to download VS Code for your respective operating system and platform.

2. Open the downloaded setup file and install it. The installation process is pretty simple and self-explanatory.

The next step is to install the XAMPP software. It provides interpreters for scripts written in the Php, along with server solutions.

## XAMPP
1. Go to this link to download XAMPP according to your OS and platform.

2. Open the downloaded setup file. Follow the setup wizard and install XAMPP.

3. Run XAMPP after the installation. Start MySQL and Apache server by clicking Start in front of it. (This has been practically done and explained in the video)

Note: If you face any issue while starting the servers in step 3 regarding Port 80, make sure port 80 is not being used by any other application such as Skype. You can check the port usage stats in the Resource Monitor of the windows OS.

Open a web browser, type localhost/phpMyAdmin in the address bar, and hit enter. The phpMyAdmin page will open, proving that the installed software and other things are working right.
